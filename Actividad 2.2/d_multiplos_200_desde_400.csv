Dear all guests,

Hi I am Hikari! I am a Japanese living in Tokyo. Nice to meet you and thank you for checking my listing.

I have been using AirBnB since 2013 for my travels in Europe, Asia and America and had a really great time in all the places I stopped over. 
As I had no trouble and really enjoyed staying at AirBnB hosts' homes, I decided to provide a similar service in Tokyo. Therefore, I hope my apartments will provide you a pleasant and comfortable stay during your travel to thrilling Japan!

If you have any questions or inquiries during your stay, I would be happy to help you. I am looking forward to welcoming you in one of my apartments/Houses.
